    <!-- <p>This amazon-clone-nuxt api. /server/server.js</p> -->
    <br />
    <a href="https://amazon-clone-client.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"
      >To Amazon Client Page</a
    >
    <br />
    <a href="https://amazon-clone-admin.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"
      >To Amazon Admin Dashboard</a
    >
    <!-- <p>If you want to access the admin dashboard, please contact me.</p> -->

    <br />
    <p>This page is only for testing purposes.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Firstly, you need to run this API page.</li>
      <li>
        And then, you can run the <span class="b-color">client page</span> and
        <span class="b-color">admin page</span> for testing.
      </li>
    </ol>
    You must run both the API page and the client/admin pages in separate tabs
    for testing.

    <p>
      This is the "amazon-clone" project build by using nuxt.js and node.js.
      This project is only in the developing stage and I added as many features
      as I can for now. And if you find any bugs to improve, please kindly
      inform me
      <a
        href="mailto:kyimyozaw122.kmz@gmail.com?subject=Query for amazon clone website"
        >@kyimyozaw122.kmz@gmail.com</a
      >. On the client page, you can test the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You can see the content of the webpage even if you are not logged in.
      </li>
      <li>You can sign up and can test the webpage buying option.</li>
      <li>
        You can go to the cart and proceed to the payment if you have input the
        necessary information (such as the delivery address and set it to
        default delivery).
      </li>
      <li>You can test add to cart but not "<b>buy</b> now option for now."</li>
      <li>You can choose the shipping options and can proceed to payment.</li>
      <li>
        When testing payment I recommend you to test with testing visa card from
        "stripe".
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          4242 4242 4242 4242 11/23 111 1111 (This is my testing visa card.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li class="r-color">Don't test with the real visa card!!!!!</li>
      <li>
        After you purchased, you can go to the "order" page to see your orders.
      </li>
      <li>You can also write reviews for the products.</li>
      <li>You can also use the search bar.</li>
    </ol>

    <br />
    And if you want to see the tested results, then you can use
    <span class="b-color"
      >"username=john2,mail=john2@gmail.com,pswd=12345#12345"</span
    >
    account.
