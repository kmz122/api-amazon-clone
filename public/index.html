    <p>This page is only for testing purposes.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Firstly, you need to run this API page.</li>
      <li>And then, you can run the client page for testing.</li>
    </ol>
    You must run both the API page and the client page in separate tabs for testing.

    <p>
      This is the "amazon-clone" project build by using nuxt.js and node.js. This project is only in the developing stage and I added as many features as I
      can for now. And if you find any bugs to improve, please kindly inform me. 

      On the client page, you can test the following:
      <ol>
        <li> You can see the content of the webpage even if you are not logged in. </li>
        <li> You can sign up and can test the webpage buying option. </li>
        <li> You can go to the cart and proceed to the payment if you have input the necessary information (such as the delivery address and set it to default delivery).</li>
        <li> You can test add to cart but not "<b>buy</b> now option for now."</li>
        <li> You can choose the shipping options and can proceed to payment.</li>
        <li> When testing payment I recommend you to test with testing visa card from "stripe". </li>
        <ul>
          <li> 4242 4242 4242 4242 11/23 111 1111 (This is my testing visa card.) </li>
        </ul>
        <li style="color:red;"> Don't test with the real visa card!!!!!</li>
        <li> After you purchased, you can go to the "order" page to see your orders.</li>
        <li>You can also write reviews for the products.</li>
        <li> You can also use the search bar. <b> (But it is only valid up to Oct 9th, 2020.)</b></li>
      </ol>
      If you want to know details, then feel free to contact me. Thanks for visiting and testing this page.
